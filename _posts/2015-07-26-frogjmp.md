title: Codility - FrogJmp in Ruby
---

[Intro to this series](http://blog.natecollings.com/posts/codility/)

[I recommend attempting the lessons first before you read my solutions.](https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/)

This one is very easy (interestingly enough, much easier than the previous one). The problem summarized is:

- A frog can jump `d` distance
- He needs to get from point `x` to point `y`
- Print the minimum number of jumps required

As `x` and `y` are both integers, the solution is basically just `((y - x) / d) + 1`. The one edge case to consider is if `y - x` is evenly divisible by `d`. That can easily be handled with a ternary statement.

[My solution](https://codility.com/demo/results/demoWDWMD3-QJS/):

```ruby
def solution(x, y, d)
  dist = y - x
  (dist / d) + (dist % d == 0 ? 0 : 1)
end
```

This is `O(1)`. My guess is that this is meant to be a simple intro to problems that need to run in constant time. Those types of problems can be pretty fun when the mathematical formula is not readily apparent. (It's very satisfying to have a `O(n^2)` problem suddenly run in `O(1)` after you determine the necessary formula.)
