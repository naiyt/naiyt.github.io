title: Coding Challenge Problems Intro
---

I quite enjoy taking "coding challenges". They are a great way to continue to hone your coding skills. Even those of us who work in software development are not typically required to solve tricky algorithmic problems or worry about running time complexity on a daily basis. However, those situations certainly will come up at some point or another, and keeping your problem solving skills sharp will absolutely help. Additionally, I find that these types of challenges are excellent for teaching you to identify and plan for edge cases, which is an important skill even if you aren't dealing with tricky problems.

Perhaps more importantly, however, is that they are just plain fun. Solving problems is something that I think most programmers inherently love. I love the way the rest of the world just melts away when I'm knee deep in a tricky problem, and the rush I get when I have finally solved a painful problem is sublime.

I've participated in various coding challenge sites. ([Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com), [Topcoder](https://topcoder.com), [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) are all ones I've enjoyed.) I've considered for awhile that I would enjoy writing blog posts about the problems I solve -- it would help encourage me to write better solutions.

This weekend I started messing with [Codility's "lessons"](https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/). These are essentially just demo/practice versions of the site's actual feature (a platform that companies can use to test engineers). Due to it being essentially just a demo, it is missing some features (e.g., the ability to save your solutions to an account). However, the problems are still interesting, and I'm enjoying proceeding through them. The next few blog posts will be discussions of the problems and my solutions to Codility problems. I plan to also post my answers to future problems from other sites.
