title: Codility Problems Intro
---

I quite enjoy taking "coding challenges". They are a great way to continue to hone your coding skills. Even those of us who work in software development are not necessarily required to solve tricky algorithmic problems or worry about running time complexity on a daily basis. However, those situations certainly will come up at some point or another, and maintaining your problem solving skills will help. Additionally, these types of challenges are excellent for teaching you to identify and plan for all possible edge cases.

Perhaps more importantly, however, is that they are just plain fun. Solving problems is something that I think most programmers inherently love. I love the way the world just kind of melts away when I'm knee deep in a tricky problem, and the rush you get when you finally have a working solution is sublime.

I've participated in various coding challenge sites before. ([Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com), [Topcoder](https://topcoder.com), [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) are all ones I've enjoyed.) I've considered for awhile that I would enjoy writing blog posts about the problems I solve -- it would help encourage me to write better solutions, and think more deeply about them in order to create a decent post on the problem. 

This weekend I started messing with [Codility's "lessons"](https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/). These are essentially just demo/practice versions of the site's actual feature (a platform that companies can use to test engineers). Due to it being essentially just a demo, it is missing some features (e.g., the ability to save your solutions to an account). However, the problems are still interesting, and I'm enjoying proceeding through them. The next few blog posts will be discussions of the problems and my solutions.
